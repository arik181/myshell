#include "myshell.h"

/*
 * Roughly your shell should do the following:
 *
 * 1. take an input string and parse it into words separated
 * by white space (tabs, blanks, and the like).  It should
 * read one line at a time (newline terminated).  Your
 * shell should exit at EOF (control-d).
 * 
 * 2. execute the command using fork, execvp, wait, and exit.
 * I.e., the shell should fork a child, let the child call
 * exec, and wait for the child to terminate.  Be careful
 * about forking; i.e., run ps or ps -elf (or top) to make
 * sure you do not have vast amounts of escaped children.
 * This may be due to the parent exiting with the children
 * still running or for other reason where the parent terminates
 * before it can call wait.
 *
 * 3. add three built-in commands: 
 *
 * 	myshell <string>...
 *
 * 	mydebug
 *
 * 	chdir <somedir>
 *
